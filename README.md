# degiro-insights
A pie chart for Degiro exported `.csv` data

To use this tool you will need to export data from <a href="trader.degiro.nl">Degiro dashboard</a> as .csv into this folder and run main.py using the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```

This will generate an image showing the pie chart for you active investments.

Eventually you can also add other fields to the csv filling only the amount of money and the name for the label to the .csv
to add other capitals to the pie chart

So far, the only supported language is IT since it's for personal usage.
